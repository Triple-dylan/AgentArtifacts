# Web App Scaffold

Next.js app-router scaffold implementing the planned information architecture:

- Home
- Catalog
- Product detail
- Bundle detail
- Free library
- Docs and guides
- Pricing and licensing
- API and registry docs

This scaffold uses the seeded CSV catalog from `/data/catalog_master.csv` for live page stats.
