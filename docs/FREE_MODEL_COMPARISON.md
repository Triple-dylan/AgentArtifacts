# Free Library vs No-Free Model

## Free Library Model

Pros:

- Better SEO and top-of-funnel growth.
- Strong lead capture and nurture potential.

Risks:

- Cannibalization risk if free scope is too large.
- Higher maintenance burden for free assets.

Upsell controls:

- Keep free scope at 20%-30% of paid value.
- Exclude full live-execution packs from free assets.
- Require email capture for high-intent lead magnets.

## No-Free Model

Pros:

- Cleaner direct monetization path.
- Reduced entitlement and support complexity.

Risks:

- Higher CAC sensitivity.
- Lower organic list growth.

Upsell controls:

- Use redacted previews and interactive demos.
- Emphasize bundle delta pricing in-cart.
- Use post-purchase upgrades and support add-ons.

## Dual-Mode Launch Policy

- Organic and content traffic defaults to Free Library route.
- Paid and high-intent traffic defaults to No-Free route.
- Shared upsell engine applies consistent trigger and suppression logic.
