# Funnel Maps

## A) Free Library Funnel (lead-capture default path)

Pros:

- Strong SEO capture and lower CAC.
- Better list growth and nurture-based conversion.

Cons:

- Requires careful gating to avoid paid cannibalization.
- Higher content operations load for free asset maintenance.

1. Traffic sources:
- SEO pages, product pages, long-tail guides, comparison posts

2. Free library offer:
- partial prompt packs
- sample skill module
- template snippets
- no full live execution connectors

3. Lead capture:
- email required for download on designated lead magnet items
- onboarding tags: role, domain, tool stack, market interest

4. Upsell email sequence:
- Day 0: delivery + setup quick win
- Day 1: usage tutorial + full version gap
- Day 3: domain use case outcome
- Day 5: bundle value comparison
- Day 7: limited-time bundle incentive
- Day 10: objections (license/support/compatibility)

5. Checkout order bumps:
- prompt -> skill
- skill -> utility/risk pack
- paper trading agent -> live upgrade bundle

6. Post-purchase upsell:
- bundle upgrade
- updates-feed subscription
- support/integration package for live-capable assets

## Gating Rules

Free:
- 20%-30% of full scope
- no full production workflow chains
- no premium support
- no redistribution

Paid:

- full compatibility coverage
- full guardrails/error handling
- commercial baseline rights

## B) No-Free Funnel (direct paid path)

Pros:

- Cleaner direct monetization and simpler entitlement boundaries.
- Stronger signal quality from high-intent buyers.

Cons:

- Higher CAC sensitivity and lower top-of-funnel volume.
- Requires stronger proof assets and conversion UX.

1. Traffic sources:
- paid search, referral, affiliate, outbound, high-intent landing pages

2. Offer mechanics:
- redacted previews and manifests
- demo walkthroughs
- clear compatibility and version confidence

3. Trial alternative:
- non-download previews, schema snippets, screenshots/video demos

4. Checkout mechanics:
- in-cart bundle delta upgrade
- relevant add-on bump

5. Post-purchase:
